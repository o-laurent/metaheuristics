## Hard optimization

Metaheuristics are algorithms which aim at solving "hard" mathematical optimization problems.

A mathematical optimization problem is defined by a "solution" $x$
and an "objective function" $f:x\mapsto\reals$ :
$$\argmin_{x \in X} f(x)$$

One can consider using $\argmax$ without loss of genericity[^argminmax].
Usually, the set $X$ is defined intentionally and constraints on $x$ are managed separately.
For example, using a function $g:x\mapsto \{0,1\}$:
$$\argmin_{x\in[0,1]^n} f(x),\quad\text{s.t.}\quad g(x)=0$$

[^argminmax]: In the metaheuristics literature, $\argmax$ is often assumed for evolutionary algorithms, whether $\argmin$ is often assumed for local search or simulated annealing.

## Naive algorithms

-   Enumeration
-   Grid search
-   Random search
-   Low-discrepency random number generators
-   Random walk

-   Stochastic convergence: there is a non-zero probability to sample the optimum
    after a finite number of steps.
-   Conventional convergence: a stochastic search will tend to stabilize over time
    on a (better) objective function value.

-   Ergodicity
-   Quasi-ergodicity
-   Necessary condition for stochasitc convergence: quasi-ergodicity.

-   When is a random walk convergent?
-   Example: 2D fixed-step size random walk.

## Descent Algorithms

Generic template:

```python
x = None
p = uniform(xmin,xmax)
for i in range(g):
    x = select(x,p)
    p = variation(x)
    p = evaluate(p)
```

Greedy algorithm:

```python
def select(x,p):
    if better(f(x),f(p)):
        return x
    else:
        return p
```

What are the conditions for which a greedy algorithm would converge?

## Simulated Annealing

```python
def select(x,p):
    if f(x) < f(p) or uniform(0,1) <= exp(-1/T*(f(p)-f(x))):
        return x
    else:
        return p
    T = decrease(T)
```

What occurs when T is high? When it is low?

Relationship to Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
Sampling in a parametrized approximation of the objective function
(i.e. from uniform to Dirac(s)).

## Evolutionary Algorithms

Generic template:

```python
P = uniform(xmin,xmax,n)
for i in range(g):
    parents = selection(P)
    offsprings = variation(parents)
    P = replacement(parents,offsprings)
```

More complete template:

```python
def evol(f):
    opt = float('inf')
    P = uniform(xmin,xmax,n)
    for i in range(g):
        parents = selection(P)
        offsprings = variation(parents)
        offsprings = evaluate(offsprings,f)
        opt = best(parents,offsprings)
        P = replacement(parents,offsprings)
    return best(P)
```

Evolution Strategies (ES), numerical space:

```python
def variation(parents):
    P = []
    for x in parents:
        P.append( x + normal(mean,variance) )
```

Genetic Algorithm (GA), boolean space:

```python
def variation(parents):
    crossed = crossover(parents)
    mutated = mutation(crossed)
    return mutated
```

Is ES convergent?
If $$#P=1$$, what are the differences with a random walk?

## Estimation of Distribution Algorithms

```python
def variation(parents, law, n):
    parameters = estimate(parents, law)
    offsprings = sample(paramaters, law, n)
    return offsprings
```

What would be an example for numerical problems?
For boolean problems?
How to ensure convergence?

### Run time and target quality

One may think that the obvious objective of an optimization algorithm is to find the location of the optimum.
While this is true for deterministic and provable optimization, it is more complex in the case of metaheuristics.
When dealing with search heuristics, the quality of the (sub)optimum found is also a performance metric,
as one want to maximize the quality of the best solution found during the search.

The two main performance metrics are thus the runtime that is necessary to find a solution of a given quality,
and conversely, the quality of the solution which can be found in a given runtime.
Of course, those two metrics tend to be contradictory: the more time is given to the search, the best the solution,
and conversely, the better the solution one want, the longer the run should be.

### Measuring time and quality

To measure the run time, a robust measure of time should be available.
However, measuring run time on a modern computer is not necessarily robust, for instance because one cannot easily
control the context switching managed by the scheduler, or because the CPU load can produce memory access contentions.
However, in practical application, the call to the objective function largely dominates any other part of the algorithm.
The number of calls to the objective function is thus a robust proxy measure of the run time.

To measure the quality of solutions, the obvious choice is to rely on absolute values.
However, this may vary a lot across problem instances and be read differently if one has a minimization or a
maximization problem.
It may thus be useful to use the error against a known bound of the problem.

### Probability of attainment

For metaheuristics which are based on randomized process (which is the vast majority of them), measuring time and
quality is not enough to estimate their performance.
Indeed, if one run several time the same "algorithm", one will get different results, hence different performances.

That's why it's more useful to consider that the "output" of an "algorithm" is not a single solution, but a random
variable, a distribution of several solutions.
If one define an "algorithm" with fuzzy concepts, like "simulated annealing" or "genetic algorithm", the reason is
obvious, because the terms encompass a large variety of possible implementations.
But one should keep in mind that even a given implementation has (a lot of) parameters, and that metaheuristics are
usually (very) sensitive to their parameter setting.

In order to have a good mental image of how to asses the performance of a solver,
one should relize that we can only _estimates_ the performances, considering _at least_ run time, quality
_and probability_ of attaining a fixed target.

### Robustness and stability

## Useful statistical tools
